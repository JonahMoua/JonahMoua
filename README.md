"Hi I'm Jonah and I graduated from University of Oregon with a degree in Biology. My interests are in Front End Engineering and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences for all devices.

Although I am a Biology major, I grew up with passion in development and engineer technologies and wanted to previously work in a lab; however, as I design frontend, I realized that this is really fun and I wanted to pursue it after graduation! One of my projects was that I designed and built a web application, Capital, which is a front end website that is built using a modern web technology stack - React, Redux, Firebase, and Components, webpack and is mobile-responsive.

I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role because I love the freedom to determine my own creativity to solutions that users experience!
